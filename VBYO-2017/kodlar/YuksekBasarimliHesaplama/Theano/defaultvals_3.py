#'In' does not know the name of the local variables y and w that are passed as arguments.
#The symbolic variable objects have name attributes (set by dscalars in the example above)
#and these are the names of the keyword parameters in the functions that we build.
#This is the mechanism at work in In(y, value=1). In the case of In(w, value=2, name='w_by_name').
#We override the symbolic variableâ€™s name attribute with a name to be used for this function.
